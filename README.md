# Intersection-traffic-flow-data-collection-system-based-on-YOLOv8-model
This is software that collects traffic flow data from drone videos of intersections or road sections. The software uses models trained on YOLOv8. This software can import the video that needs to collect data, and export the video after data collection and the traffic volume collected.<br />

ðŸš€**Intersection exit count:** In traffic flow analysis, exit lanes at each intersection are visually represented in different colors to clearly show the volume of traffic passing through that exit lane.<br />
ðŸš€**Vehicle trajectory display:** Visual display of vehicle trajectory data to facilitate in-depth analysis of vehicle movement patterns. <br />
ðŸš€**Vehicle log output:** After video analysis, the software will automatically generate a detailed traffic flow record, including the unique identification number of each vehicle and the vehicle count of each exit lane.<br />
